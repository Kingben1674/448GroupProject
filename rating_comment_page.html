	<p class = "userCom"> Really enjoyed my visit to this restaurant. Our waiter Maximo was superb. 
	His customer service was on point. We never needed or wanted for anything. 
	The food was piping hot and succulent. The establishment was cozy. 
	I appreciate the downtown industrial architecture and vibe. We'll definitely frequent the establishment again. </p>

	<p class = "userCom"> So stop in here for beer and a burger during the Baltimore Comic-Con. 
	It's location is certainly convenient, so the place was loaded with all things comic book and cosplay. <br> <br>
	I had a pretty tasty cheese burger, something I had been craving for some time. I also scored some delicious sweet potato fries.
	All and all, this place provided a solid lunch before my journey home. <br> <br>

	Of course, the biggest problem here was the service several of the bartenders seemed a bit lost, and I had to wait a bit to get their attention. </p>

	<p class = "userCom"> Hate to leave a post like this about any place but... <br>
	Wings were the worst I've ever had! I ordered jerk wings and they were fried to a crisp. 
	I've had better wings at Walmart deli... On a positive note, beer was cold and delicious... </p>
